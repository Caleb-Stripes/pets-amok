TDD for Animal super class which will contain the instance variables that organic and robotic animals share


Foreseeable Code Objectives
***************************

TDD Organic class that will be parent class for organic dog and organic cat classes

TDD Robotic class that will be parent class for robotic dog and robotic cat classes

TDD o-dog, o-cat, r-dog and r-cat classes

TDD interface for Animals and 'implement' it in Animal Class

TDD interface for Organic Animals and 'implement' it in the Organic Animal Class 

TDD interface for Robotic Animals and 'implement' it in the Robotic Animal Class

TDD shelter cages and litter boxes

TDD shelter robot pets oil and charge levels

Review that all variables are properly encapsulated

Review that all methods have correct visibility modifiers

Code in an over-all health variable based on the other statistics of the animals

Revise or Code dogWalk method to decrease chance to soil cage and increase happiness

Code oiling and charging methods for robotic pets

Insure that robot pets can't be fed or watered and organic pets cannot be oiled or charged

Modify organic tick() to indicate the amount of waste a pet creates

Introduce methods that allow user to walkAllDogs, cleanAllCages, emptyAllLitterBoxes, and oilAllRobots

In addition to previous shelter applications functions, add options for the do-all methods
