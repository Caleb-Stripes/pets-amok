Completed Code Objectives
*************************

TDD for Animal super class which will contain the instance variables that organic and robotic animals share

TDD Organic class that will be parent class for organic dog and organic cat classes

TDD Robotic class that will be parent class for robotic dog and robotic cat classes

TDD o-dog [x], o-cat [x], r-dog [x] and r-cat [x] classes

Get the catTick() poo part to add to the pooLevel of the LitterBox object created in the Shelter class. *Changed litterbox to a static variable in the Shelter class, this could cause issues if the shelter class is intended to be instantiated as an object in other classes, but for now satisfies the need of collecting cat poo.

TDD interface for Animals and 'implement' it in Animal Class (The interface has been created under the name OrganicAnimalThings
and contains abstract methods for play, eat, drink and poo. It should be implemented by dog and cat).

TDD interface for Organic Animals and 'implement' it in the Organic Animal Class 

TDD shelter cages and litter boxes

Modify organic tick() to indicate the amount of waste a pet creates

Code oiling and charging methods for robotic pets

Revise or Code dogWalk method to decrease chance to soil cage and increase happiness (this will use iterable/iterator)

TDD shelter robot pets oil and charge levels

Insure that robot pets can't be fed or watered and organic pets cannot be oiled or charged

Current Code Objectives
***********************

Introduce methods that allow user to walkAllDogs, cleanAllCages, emptyAllLitterBoxes, and oilAllRobots

Foreseeable Code Objectives
***************************

Review that all variables are properly encapsulated

Review that all methods have correct visibility modifiers

Code in an over-all health variable based on the other statistics of the animals

In addition to previous shelter applications functions, add options for the do-all methods
